import pandas as pd

#A. Read the csv file into a pandas object
#B. Give counts per pre-type and post type
#C.1. Create a dict of all unique pre and/or post IDs, mapped to type (e.g. pyramidal neuron, layer 4)
    2. Find the IDs of things of things that are neurons
#D. For each UID that is a neuron (either presynaptic or postsynaptic) create an object which contains 1. Neuron type, 2. Layer,
# 3. a dataframe of its input synapses 4. a dataframe of its output synapses, also both 3 and 4, filtered by where the input/output is a neuron.
________
#E. Also make a dictionary with key (neuron type, neuron layer), and value is a list of neurons
